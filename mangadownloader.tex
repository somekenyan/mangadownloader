\section{Introduction}

This document is to show me what I have implemented in the mangadownloader program. Currently I am working on only downloading from mangapanda

\section{Modules}
These are the small pieces of the program that will be combined to get the big program

\begin{itemize}
\item Download images
It should download an image from a page, give it an approppriate name depending on the page number and then save it to the appropriate folder
\item Download manga chapter
This should be able to download a complete manga, going through the pages and getting all the pages
\item List episodes
This should be able to list various chapters of the manga
\item List anime
This should be able to list all the anime manga in the site
\end{itemize}


\section{Implementations}

I can already download images although still not sure about the saving of the images.

I get a list of all the chapters. This will then be passed to imagedownload function downloading the images sequentially

I can get the link of the image to be downloaded from the site.
